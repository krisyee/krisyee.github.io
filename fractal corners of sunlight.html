    <p>
        There are fewer than 12 hours until the next day. The day is warm — topping 80 degrees in the middle of August. Today, I feel self-doubt, so I come to this blank screen hoping to purge it. Words don’t make money. I think about the fact that ‘money’ is five words richer than I am, sometimes. I feel stuck. I keep telling myself words are a dying art. I keep telling myself I’m better off doing something else. But the force pulling my fingers towards these keys — stronger than the gravitational force that places my feet to the earth — is undeniable. Today my fingers dance again. Today I smell the earthy warmth of a spring day, bask in the fractal corners of sunlight between the leaves, feel that tightness in my chest, the feeling of my mind chasing far ahead of myself, and know that I want to write. Because I could starve, but I don’t think that I could starve my desire to write. These letters, these words, meaningless, and full of the world.
