    <h1 id="title"> silence after phone calls</h1>
    <p>
        Dear traveler,  <br> <br>


        My mama (妈妈) keeps telling me to journal this “extraordinary moment in time,” but that phrasing just doesn’t quite sit right with me. I keep getting this itch that there’s another better way to phrase it, but maybe there isn’t. Maybe I’m overthinking it (like I always do), or maybe it’s that these past few months at home have felt, if anything, less extraordinary than ever. Like a sort of paralysis, trapped in the amber sunlight of my childhood bedroom. I wake up in the same bed I woke up in every day of high school—to pastel purple walls, a white ceiling—and bleary grogginess washes over me like a sheet of fog. It’s that feeling you get in the morning when you don’t feel like you need to open your eyes immediately because you’ve already memorized exactly what everything will look like you when you do. 
        
        
       <br><br> I made the decision a few days ago that I wouldn’t be returning to Berkeley in the fall, so I guess I’ll have to get used to being used to everything (see! overthinker caught in the act!). My heart is conflicted. My introvert and homebody sing to be around my loving family. But I miss everyone and everything about Berkeley, too. I miss seeing crowds of people and getting lost in new faces. I miss finding the familiar ones amidst them. I even miss struggling to navigate all the awkward social situations I undoubtedly managed to put myself in. 
        
        
      <br><br>  And the worst part—the sickeningly sweet maraschino cherry atop the tumultuous sundae that has been 2020—is that I never really felt like I got closure on any of the craziness of freshman year. No cheesy letters, no teary hugs, no sentimental farewells to every inch of my dorm building (yes, even the ugly, slow, yellow-and-silver-striped Griffiths elevator). The phone calls and Facetimes I’ve had, trying to fill that void, always end in a deafening, abrupt silence. 
        
        
       <br><br>  It’s one thing to say goodbye to someone in person and walk away, slowly increasing that distance, but to hang up the phone is to be far-flung in an instant. 
        
        
      <br><br>  I know that there’s a lot to be grateful for, and being with my family these past weeks, I realize even more now than ever how great a blessing they are. But we’re human. We find things to be anxious about, and we get lost in the sharp vividity of our memories. We forget that each day we live doesn’t have to be filled only with positive thoughts, while we struggle to swallow down the dark, uneasy ones. It just needs to be lived. Sometimes that means drinking a big cup of coffee after 13 hours of sleep (come on, we’ve all been there). Or it might mean taking the time to cry and listen to sad songs for no reason. Still other times it means laughing with loved ones so hard you feel your stomach twisting. 
        
        
     <br><br>   The silence after a phone call can be loud and deafening and scary, but you can always call again. And when you do, you’ll sink back into warm conversations and remember that silence is always just temporary.
