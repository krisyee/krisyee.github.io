        ðŸ’Œ Dear traveler, <br> <br>


         Summer break is coming to an end. I donâ€™t know where youâ€™re at right now, but I hope itâ€™s sunny today. This morning was cloudy and filled with the stress of a much-dreaded statistics final, but the sun is now shining brightly through the window, and Iâ€™m feeling a little drowsy. Take a moment to look somewhere far out your window and just take in the familiar sight. Youâ€™ll find it banal but comforting, like the first sip of a warm cup of tea. 
        
        
        <br> <br>  Apparently, I only have a week until my sophomore year begins. Time is passing in really weird ways. An hour feels like a week, but a week only feels like a few days, and a few days feel like a year. I can barely process the fact that about a year ago, I was probably drowning in a confusing, overstimulating, emotional season of change. And now Iâ€™m here, at the polar opposite end. I feel like Iâ€™m being forced into a new school year, pushed into it headfirst. Itâ€™s crazy to think that Iâ€™ll be making a semesterâ€™s worth of memories in the small, lavender square of the universe that is my room. Itâ€™ll definitely be different, but hopefully not in a terrible way. Iâ€™m sure weâ€™ll come out having learned things, having made memories, having tried our best, in ways we never imagined we could have. Humans are oddly malleable beingsâ€”weâ€™ll get through it. 
        
        
        <br> <br>  How is your emotional state right now? Are you feeling burnt out? Itâ€™s okay to not quite be sure. Quarantine has made us very prone to emotional constipation (very elegant phrasing, I know). Take the time to analyze. And when someone asks you how youâ€™re feeling over a Zoom call and youâ€™re not sure, donâ€™t just tell them that youâ€™re fine if thatâ€™s not truly what youâ€™re feeling. Tell them that youâ€™re not sure. Or that youâ€™re feeling overwhelmed, or underwhelmed. The more honest we are with each other, the easier things will be for each other and for ourselves. 
        
        
        <br> <br>  Lying about my emotional state is a trap that I feel like Iâ€™ve been falling back into recently. I did that a lot in high school too, looking back. To that end, a small reminder: it's okay to revert back to old habits. You may have thrown those habits away for a while, thinking you didnâ€™t need them, or that they were holding you back. Maybe they werenâ€™t good for you. Maybe you did need to throw them away. But if you fall back into them, think of them as a nudge (hopefully, a gentle one). Think of it as coincidentally bumping into an old childhood friend: there is the chance of a rekindling or the chance of re-departure, but itâ€™s eventually your choice. So when you do find yourself going back into those habits, decide for yourself whether theyâ€™re worth rekindling. After all, you were a different person when you first developed these habits, a different person when you threw away these habits, and a different person now. 
        
        
        <br> <br> Anyways, I hope youâ€™ve had the time to take care of yourself! I'm sorry that I haven't been very intentional about reaching out (never been the best at that). I hope that you made yourself something delicious, or danced in your bedroom for no reason, or had some alone time with God, or cherished time with friends over call (even though it literally turns my computer into a sizzling frying pan). I know that everyone has a different family situation, so I hope and pray that things are going well with your family as well. 
        <br> <br>
        
        Much love,<br>
